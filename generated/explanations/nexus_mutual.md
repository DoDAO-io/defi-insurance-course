 ## Nexus Mutual
 
 **Introduction**        
Nexus Mutual is the most significant Defi insurance protocol in the cryptocurrency market. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) as of 1 May 2021 is $450 million, as opposed to $7 million for Cover Protocol, the second-largest Defi insurance protocol. Hugh Karp, a former CFO of Munich Re in the UK, launched Nexus Mutual.

Nexus Mutual is a decentralized protocol that enables organizations and people to buy insurance policies that guard against the particular risks associated with platforms that are decentralized (DeFi) or centralized (CeFi). Without the need for a centralized insurance provider, Nexus Mutual is an Ethereum-based platform that enables users from all over the world to share insurance risks. The members of the Nexus Mutual platform decide whether claims are legitimate, and smart contracts record and enforce their choices. This eliminates the need to have faith in an insurance company because claim payments are enforced by token-driven economic incentives. All mutual members have legal agreements supporting their membership rights, represented by cryptocurrency tokens used throughout the insurance platform.
 
 **Types of Covers**        
Nexus Mutual consists of three types of covers-

1. Protocol Covers 
2. Custody Cover 
3. Yield Token Cover

Cover is only ever applicable to specific types of events and is always protocol- or token-specific. A protocol cover policy, for instance, won't safeguard money held on a custodial platform. Cover is used as an alternative to “insurance” in traditional finance.

### Protocol Covers
Protocol covers are generally to protect and safeguards assets in the event of a protocol, smart contract failure, or oracle misuse. They are necessary because smart contacts can be hacked due to flaws in them. Primarily it includes-

1. Economic design failure 
2. Governance attacks
3. Severe oracle failure 
4. Protection for Non-Ethereum smart contracts
5. Protection for assets on Layer-2

### Custody Covers
In the case of an attack on a custodial platform—one that seizes custody of user cash when they engage with it—this kind of insurance protects that money. Cover the dangers of money being stolen or the withdrawal being stopped. Popular custodial platforms include Coinbase and BlockFi. 

### Yield Token Cover
Funds are protected by yield token cover in the event that a yield token—a token included in a yield-generating protocol, like yDAI—loses its peg to its underlying asset and therefore loses some of its value. There is protection against yield token protocol failure or peg loss for Yearn, Convex, Idle USDT, and other cryptocurrencies.
 
 **NXM Token**        
The governance token of the mutual, NXM, is used to connect the internal economics of the mutual so that the platform may respond dynamically to market conditions and capitalization levels and reward active members for participating in the mutual's daily operations. To hold NXM, one must be a member of the mutual. 


Members can take part in risk and claim assessments using NXM. The cost of cover, which may also be purchased with ETH and DAI, can also be paid with NXM. Members can also take part in governance by casting NXM votes on ideas. Members decide the protocol's destiny through these votes.
 
 **Claim Assesment**        
Members who stake NXM act as claim assessors and decide whether to approve a claim. The claims are processed within 72 hours. For a claim that needs approval, the loss of funds must-

1. Fall into various categories which are mentioned in the cover policy contract
2. Occur within the defined time period
3. Be significant enough to account for as a claim

The claimant must additionally provide evidence of their loss or that they were unable to withdraw money. This might be a 0-value transaction or a signature. An account statement, a notification from the protocol describing a hack, or another sort of warning could serve as additional proof.
