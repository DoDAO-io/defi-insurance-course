 **Background**        
## Rise of Crypto
The rise of blockchain and crypto currencies has brought about a number of changes in the technology and financial sector, which has in turn opened up the possibility - and need - for new types of organizations and products which did not exist before. 

We've seen a lot of new, innovative ways to raise capital, align community interests, and make rewards or payments using a native currency. And on the human coordination front, we see that teams of hundreds or thousands of people can work together towards a common goal with aligned incentives. The members can choose to be completely anonymous. Blockchain Technology has made it easy to write small software programs (smart contracts) that can lay out completely flexible rules on how money can be collected or given out. 

## Need for DeFi Insurance
The DeFi market has been plagued by hacks, bugs, exploits, rug-pulls, and flash loan attacks since its early days, leading to a loss of confidence among users and preventing mainstream adoption. While technological maturity will reduce many of the vulnerabilities, it will not be able to make the system risk-proof. Insurance solutions can help protect users in these situations.

In most cases, the funds that users have stored in banks in developed nations are backed by the government. This means that if a bank were to go bankrupt, the government would cover the customer's losses up to a certain limit. A good insurance infrastructure is crucial for users of developed nations if we want them to use open blockchain technologies as their primary way of interacting with the financial ecosystem.

## Current State of DeFi Insurance
As of the start of 2023, the total value locked in the DeFi ecosystem is about ~$52 billion with an all-time high of about ~250 billion in January of 2022. (Source: DeFi Llama). DeFi insurance makes up less than 1% of total TVL in DeFi. In insurance, we see ~210 million TLV and out of that, ~170 million of TVL is represented by Nexus Mutual.

Adoption of DeFi applications has been growing rapidly in recent months, with lending & borrowing and exchanges being the two most popular categories. One of the main reasons for their popularity is that most of the functionality provided by these projects is purely code and algorithm driven, which removes the need for a middleman and makes the entire system more transparent, trustable and efficient.

On the other hand, even though DeFi insurance still requires human intervention when it comes to filing and evaluating claims, we will see more and more trustable, code-driven decisions being made about claims in the coming years. 
 **Current problems with Insurance Industry**        
There are many problems faced by insurance companies
1) **Misaligned Incentives** - An insurer offers guaranteed support in case of emergency or unforeseen 
    circumstances, and in exchange, they charge a premium to customers. The interests of insurers and insured 
    people are opposite; an insurer would want to pay out minimal claims and get maximum insurance premiums, but 
    an insured person would want to get maximum coverage with minimal premium.

    In many crypto projects, customers are the shareholders. This provides the best balance for product offerings 
    as it incentivizes businesses to be honest and transparent with their users. If, for example, the insured is 
    also a shareholder in the business, then the insurer will be more likely to pay out claims honestly in order 
    to avoid losing money. However, if the insurer doesn't have to pay out any claims, then the shareholders will 
    still make money.

2) **Capital Requirements** - The insurance industry is a capital-intensive
   business. The more capital you have, the more people you can insure, and the
   more premiums you can get. This in turn reduces your risk and allows you to
   charge lower premiums to customers. However, this creates a chicken-and-egg
   problem for smaller startups. They can't easily enter the industry because
   of the high capital requirements and economies of scale. This lack of
   competition means higher premiums for customers.


3) **Inefficiencies** -  The insurance industry, like the banking sector, is
   highly regulated. This can make it difficult for new, innovative companies
   to enter the market. And because the bigger players rely on outdated
   technologies and processes, they can be quite inefficient. This inefficiency
   leads to higher premiums for customers.

   However, with real-time analytics and reporting, most of the regulation can be simplified and made 
   real-time. This would lead to better use of technology, reduced costs for entrance into the industry, 
   and improved day-to-day operations.

4) **Transparency** - An insurance company will only be transparent with its users if it aligns with their 
   interests. However, as noted, the interests of the insurance company and policy buyers are often opposite. 
   Additionally, no company would want to expose its inefficiencies to the public. Because of these fundamental 
   issues, companies often don't want to be transparent. 

5) **New sectors are not insured** - The insurance industry is notoriously slow-moving and risk-averse, which has 
   resulted in many sectors being left out and not enjoying the benefits of insurance. For example, the crypto 
   industry currently holds around $800 billion, but only a tiny percentage of that is insured. 
 **Important Concepts**        
### Law of Large Numbers insurance companies base their future estimates of losses on the law of large numbers. For example, an actuary will  look at past losses and predict that, in the future, approximately two out of every 100 policyholders will have a  claim. Thus, if the company writes 100 automobile policies, it can expect to pay out two claims. This is referred  to as loss frequency.

Insurers need to calculate the average cost of claims over time, or loss severity. If the average claim costs the  company $1,000, then the Actuary will predict that total losses for the upcoming year will be $2,000 (two claims  at $1,000 each).
The law of large numbers says that as the number of policyholders increases, the insurance company is more confident  its prediction will be accurate. So they try to get a lot of similar policyholders who all contribute to a fund  that will pay the losses.
### Premium Calculation Insurance companies use risk data to calculate the likelihood of an event occurring that you are insuring  against. This information is used to determine the cost of your premium. The higher the risk to the insurer, the  higher the likelihood of the event occurring, and as a result, the higher the cost of your premium. When  determining premiums, insurers consider whether the person who wants to take out a policy is a bigger or smaller  risk than the average policyholder. For example, a young person with a high-powered car may be charged a higher  premium because they are statistically more likely to be involved in an accident than a mature, experienced driver.
Only a proportion of policyholders will make a claim in any one year. 
### Cover Providers Cover providers are organizations that offer coverage or protection against various risks or liabilities. DeFi  protocols have made it easier to access capital by pooling assets. This allows users and companies to purchase  coverage from a decentralized group of cover providers, instead of having to buy it from a centralized entity. 

 Cover providers invest their funds in pools with higher returns relative to the protocol's risk, which means that 
 individuals trade the outcomes of events based on their estimations of the probability of the underlying risk event. 

 By using DeFi protocols, individuals and companies can get the coverage they need without having to go through a 
 centralized entity. This gives them more control over their finances and helps to keep costs down.
