 **Background**        
## Intro Insurance is one of the most important things to have in order to feel secure financially. A good insurance policy can  give someone peace of mind and the freedom to not have to worry about losing everything they've worked for in the event  of an accident or other unforeseen circumstance. In developed nations, a good insurance framework protects people from  having to worry about their health, their life, and their material possessions like their car, house, or business in  the event of an unexpected event.
Insurance companies have been around for many years, but not a lot has changed in how they operate. In fact, trust in  these companies has been decreasing every year. Insurance is a type of industry that requires a lot of money to get  started, which prevents startups from entering the space and thus preventing any real change or innovation in the  insurance industry.  
## Challenges with Traditional Insurance There are a few key issues that need to be addressed within the insurance industry: 1) The relationship between insurance companies and their customers is adversarial - meaning that companies profit more when customers make fewer claims. 2) There is a lack of trust because insurance contracts are often complex and designed to protect the organization rather than the customer. 3) ~30-40% of capital goes towards operational expenses.  4) High capital requirements makes it difficult for startups to join the industry, which in turn stifles innovation. 5) Core insurance business models are decades old and have seen little innovation in recent years. 6) The insurance industry is notoriously slow-moving and risk-averse, which has 
      resulted in many sectors being left out and not enjoying the benefits of insurance. For example, the crypto 
      industry currently holds around $800 billion, but only a tiny percentage of that is insured. 
 **DeFi and Inusrance**        
## DeFi and Insurance Blockchain and DeFi are not just about transferring tokens from one person to another - they offer a lot of new finance  primitives that have changed how finance companies operate. Some of the new innovations in DeFi that relate to the  insurance industry include ...
### 1. Raising Capital Tokenization and mechanisms like bonding curves and staking have made it easier to raise capital. These new innovative  methods reward early investors who take risks and believe in the vision.
For example, when using a bonding curve to raise funds, people who invest at an earlier stage can get more tokens than  those investing at later stages.
### 2. Aligning Interests Token models create flexiblity and allows protocols/projects to use innovative methods to ensure that everyone's  interests are aligned with common goals. For example, some of the most prominent functions in an insurance company  are claims assessment, treasury management, and underwriting. By adding rewards and penalizing wrong behavior, it  will bring interests closer together to achieve common goals.
Moreover, different types of distribution models for tokens usually have a preference for long-term token holders  who have confidence in the project as opposed to those who are only focused on short-term token prices.
### 3. New Coordination Models Coordination models enabled by DeFi and DAO have opened up opportunities for new types of organizations, in which  members may not even know one another's identities, but can still work together effectively. 
In traditional organizations, decisions are made by top management, and all employees work towards meeting those  goals. In DAOs, teams vote on proposals in a democratic way. This gives members a voice, as anyone can create and  submit proposals, and by voting the community develops a sense of collective ownership.
We are still in the experimental stage when it comes to DAOs, but we are already seeing that they can be much more  efficient than traditional organizations in many ways.
### 4. Customer and Insurance Company on same side  In traditional insurance companies, the relationship between the company and its customers is usually one where they're  against each other. This is because in order for the organization to grow, they need more funds which often comes from  raising prices or finding new customers. However, in the DeFi space most operations are handled by code which means  that the cost of serving 10,000 customers is pretty much the same as serving 100,000 customers. This provides an  incentive for DeFi projects to develop products that are relevant and achieve mass adoption.
Most Decentralized Finance protocols share profits among participants, and allow anyone to participate. This allows  customers to also participate and become stakeholders in the success of the protocol. This helps to create a sense of  ownership and responsibility among those using the protocol, and it also encourages continued usage and engagement as  users will want to see the project they're a part of succeed.
### 5. Transparency How confident would you be in your insurance provider if you knew their total funds, profit margins, exact formula for  calculating premiums, and day-to-day operations? This is how most DeFi protocols operate.
By having data on the blockchain, anyone can query it and see how it has changed over time. This develops confidence and also enables people outside the organization to provide critical feedback and insights.

## Rise of Crypto
The rise of blockchain and crypto currencies has brought about a number of changes in the technology and financial sector, which has in turn opened up the possibility - and need - for new types of organizations and products which did not exist before. 

We've seen a lot of new, innovative ways to raise capital, align community interests, and make rewards or payments using a native currency. And on the human coordination front, we see that teams of hundreds or thousands of people can work together towards a common goal with aligned incentives. The members can choose to be completely anonymous. Blockchain Technology has made it easy to write small software programs (smart contracts) that can lay out completely flexible rules on how money can be collected or given out. 

## Need for DeFi Insurance
The DeFi market has been plagued by hacks, bugs, exploits, rug-pulls, and flash loan attacks since its early days, leading to a loss of confidence among users and preventing mainstream adoption. While technological maturity will reduce many of the vulnerabilities, it will not be able to make the system risk-proof. Insurance solutions can help protect users in these situations.

In most cases, the funds that users have stored in banks in developed nations are backed by the government. This means that if a bank were to go bankrupt, the government would cover the customer's losses up to a certain limit. A good insurance infrastructure is crucial for users of developed nations if we want them to use open blockchain technologies as their primary way of interacting with the financial ecosystem.

## Current State of DeFi Insurance
As of the start of 2023, the total value locked in the DeFi ecosystem is about ~$52 billion with an all-time high of about ~250 billion in January of 2022. (Source: DeFi Llama). DeFi insurance makes up less than 1% of total TVL in DeFi. In insurance, we see ~210 million TLV and out of that, ~170 million of TVL is represented by Nexus Mutual.

Adoption of DeFi applications has been growing rapidly in recent months, with lending & borrowing and exchanges being the two most popular categories. One of the main reasons for their popularity is that most of the functionality provided by these projects is purely code and algorithm driven, which removes the need for a middleman and makes the entire system more transparent, trustable and efficient.

On the other hand, even though DeFi insurance still requires human intervention when it comes to filing and evaluating claims, we will see more and more trustable, code-driven decisions being made about claims in the coming years.
## Law of Large Numbers 
Insurance companies base their future estimates of losses on the law of large numbers. For example, an actuary will  look at past losses and predict that, in the future, approximately two out of every 100 policyholders will have a  claim. Thus, if the company writes 100 automobile policies, it can expect to pay out two claims. This is referred  to as loss frequency.

Insurers need to calculate the average cost of claims over time, or loss severity. If the average claim costs the  company `$1,000`, then the Actuary will predict that total losses for the upcoming year will be `$2,000` (two claims  at `$1,000` each).

The law of large numbers says that as the number of policyholders increases, the insurance company is more confident  its prediction will be accurate. So they try to get a lot of similar policyholders who all contribute to a fund  that will pay the losses.

## Premium Calculation 
Insurance companies use risk data to calculate the likelihood of an event occurring that you are insuring  against. This information is used to determine the cost of your premium. The higher the risk to the insurer, the  higher the likelihood of the event occurring, and as a result, the higher the cost of your premium. When  determining premiums, insurers consider whether the person who wants to take out a policy is a bigger or smaller  risk than the average policyholder. For example, a young person with a high-powered car may be charged a higher  premium because they are statistically more likely to be involved in an accident than a mature, experienced driver.
Only a proportion of policyholders will make a claim in any one year. 

## Cover Providers 
Cover providers are organizations that offer coverage or protection against various risks or liabilities. DeFi  protocols have made it easier to access capital by pooling assets. This allows users and companies to purchase  coverage from a decentralized group of cover providers, instead of having to buy it from a centralized entity. 

 Cover providers invest their funds in pools with higher returns relative to the protocol's risk, which means that individuals trade the outcomes of events based on their estimations of the probability of the underlying risk event. 

 By using DeFi protocols, individuals and companies can get the coverage they need without having to go through a centralized entity. This gives them more control over their finances and helps to keep costs down.
