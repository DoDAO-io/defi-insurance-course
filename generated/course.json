      "details": "Insurance in decentralized finance (DeFi) works in much the same way as traditional insurance, with a few key differences. In traditional insurance, a policyholder pays premiums to an insurance company, which provides financial protection in the event of a loss or other covered event. In DeFi, insurance is typically provided by a smart contract on a blockchain, rather than by a traditional insurance company.\nHere are some key points to consider when thinking about insurance in DeFi:\n* Risk pooling: DeFi insurance typically works by pooling the premiums paid by policyholders into a shared fund. This fund is used to pay out claims in the event of a loss or covered event.\n* Smart contracts: DeFi insurance is typically provided through smart contracts on a blockchain. These smart contracts automate the process of calculating premiums, paying out claims, and managing the risk pool.\n* Transparency: Because DeFi insurance is provided through smart contracts on a blockchain, the terms of the insurance policy and the status of the risk pool are typically transparent and verifiable. This can give policyholders more confidence in the fairness and reliability of the insurance process.\n* Customization: DeFi insurance can be customized to meet the specific needs of policyholders. For example, a policyholder might be able to choose the specific risks they want to be covered for, or select a premium payment schedule that meets their needs.\n* Overall, DeFi insurance is a promising new application of blockchain technology that has the potential to make insurance more transparent, efficient, and accessible.\n\n",

          "details": "## Background \nInsurance is one of the most important things to have in order to feel secure financially. A good insurance policy can  give someone peace of mind and the freedom to not have to worry about losing everything they've worked for in the event  of an accident or other unforeseen circumstance. In developed nations, a good insurance framework protects people from  having to worry about their health, their life, and their material possessions like their car, house, or business in  the event of an unexpected event.\n\nInsurance companies have been around for many years, but not a lot has changed in how they operate. In fact, trust in  these companies has been decreasing every year. Insurance is a type of industry that requires a lot of money to get  started, which prevents startups from entering the space and thus preventing any real change or innovation in the  insurance industry.  \n\n## Challenges with Traditional Insurance \nThere are a few key issues that need to be addressed within the insurance industry: \n1) The relationship between insurance companies and their customers is adversarial - meaning that companies profit more when customers make fewer claims. \n2) There is a lack of trust because insurance contracts are often complex and designed to protect the organization rather than the customer. \n3) ~30-40% of capital goes towards operational expenses.  \n4) High capital requirements makes it difficult for startups to join the industry, which in turn stifles innovation. \n5) Core insurance business models are decades old and have seen little innovation in recent years.\n6) The insurance industry is notoriously slow-moving and risk-averse, which has resulted in many sectors being left out and not enjoying the benefits of insurance."

          "details": "## DeFi and Insurance \nBlockchain and DeFi are not just about transferring tokens from one person to another - they offer a lot of new finance  primitives that have changed how finance companies operate. Some of the new innovations in DeFi that relate to the  insurance industry include ...\n\n### 1. Raising Capital \nTokenization and mechanisms like bonding curves and staking have made it easier to raise capital. These new innovative  methods reward early investors who take risks and believe in the vision.\n\nFor example, when using a bonding curve to raise funds, people who invest at an earlier stage can get more tokens than  those investing at later stages.\n\n### 2. Aligning Interests \nToken models create flexiblity and allows protocols/projects to use innovative methods to ensure that everyone's  interests are aligned with common goals. For example, some of the most prominent functions in an insurance company  are claims assessment, treasury management, and underwriting. By adding rewards and penalizing wrong behavior, it  will bring interests closer together to achieve common goals.\n\nMoreover, different types of distribution models for tokens usually have a preference for long-term token holders  who have confidence in the project as opposed to those who are only focused on short-term token prices.\n\n### 3. New Coordination Models \nCoordination models enabled by DeFi and DAO have opened up opportunities for new types of organizations, in which  members may not even know one another's identities, but can still work together effectively. \n\nIn traditional organizations, decisions are made by top management, and all employees work towards meeting those  goals. In DAOs, teams vote on proposals in a democratic way. This gives members a voice, as anyone can create and  submit proposals, and by voting the community develops a sense of collective ownership.\n\nWe are still in the experimental stage when it comes to DAOs, but we are already seeing that they can be much more  efficient than traditional organizations in many ways.\n\n### 4. Customer and Insurance Company on same side \nIn traditional insurance companies, the relationship between the company and its customers is usually one where they're  against each other. This is because in order for the organization to grow, they need more funds which often comes from  raising prices or finding new customers. However, in the DeFi space most operations are handled by code which means  that the cost of serving 10,000 customers is pretty much the same as serving 100,000 customers. This provides an  incentive for DeFi projects to develop products that are relevant and achieve mass adoption.\n\nMost Decentralized Finance protocols share profits among participants, and allow anyone to participate. This allows  customers to also participate and become stakeholders in the success of the protocol. This helps to create a sense of  ownership and responsibility among those using the protocol, and it also encourages continued usage and engagement as  users will want to see the project they're a part of succeed.\n\n### 5. Transparency \nHow confident would you be in your insurance provider if you knew their total funds, profit margins, exact formula for  calculating premiums, and day-to-day operations? This is how most DeFi protocols operate.\n\nBy having data on the blockchain, anyone can query it and see how it has changed over time. This develops confidence and also enables people outside the organization to provide critical feedback and insights.  You can see all the major data points for the leading DeFi insurance provider - Nexus Mutual - [here](https://nexustracker.io/) \n\n### 6. Innovation \n\nTraditional insurance companies are hamstrung by bureaucracy and are slow to address newer, unestablished sectors.  However, the composable nature of DeFi primitives enables rapid innovation and offers new business models that are  not available in traditional insurance companies.\n\nFor example, the crypto industry currently holds around $800 billion, but only a tiny percentage of that is insured.  Now there are a few DeFi insurance companies that offer crypto insurance which includes smart contract exploits, loss  of funds etc. This provides a much needed service for the rapidly growing crypto industry."

          "details": "We will be discussing some of the new business models we see in DeFi insurance protocols below. We will also be \ndiscussing each of the DeFi Insurance Protocols in detail separately.\n\n### Mutual or Cooperatives\nBefore insurance companies came into existence, communities would band together and pool resources in order to \nprotect individual members from risks they all faced. If an unfortunate event occurred, the senior members of the \ncommunity would decide whether or not to provide assistance. All funds raised were used to benefit the members of \nthe community.\n\nStarting a mutual or cooperative can be complicated and expensive, with legal fees often running into the tens of \nthousands of dollars.There are also many other challenges that exist in cooperatives, such as taking common decisions, \nvoting, and rewarding active participants over inactive members. The recent DAO movement in cryptocurrency is trying \nto address many of these solutions and offers software solutions for many of these problems.\n\nNexusMutual is the most prominent DeFi insurance protocol, and it takes a cooperative approach to business. To \nparticipate or buy insurance cover, one must be a member of the mutual. With this business model, both the cover \nproviders and insurance cover buyers work towards the success of the protocol.\n\nThis approach ensures that everyone has a vested interest in the success of the protocol, and that everyone is working \ntogether to make it successful. This cooperative approach is what makes NexusMutual different from traditional \ninsurance providers.\n\n### Provide Warranty(Assurance)\nBigger companies have the advantage when it comes to offering warranties for their products and services. If a customer \nis dissatisfied with a purchase, they can receive a refund or some other form of compensation. This makes it difficult \nfor smaller businesses to compete in the same market.\n\nTokenization can help startups by providing interesting models that solve problems related to the product or service \nwarranties. For example, a startup could ask investors to stake some funds to help offset the risk of a warranty, and \nin return the startup would reward them with a portion of the premiums. This is somewhat similar to how public \ninsurance companies work, where the profits go to shareholders. However, DeFi provides a lot more flexibility \nto investors, allowing them to invest and then earn based on their knowledge and risk appetite.\n\nIn one of the sections, we will discuss the Sherlock protocol in detail. This protocol offers companies warranties against \nany funds loss that may occur as a result of security exploits in the code that has been audited.\n\n### Reciprocal Insurance\nThere are three primary ways to structure an insurance company: the stock model, the mutual model, and the reciprocal \nmodel. The reciprocal model is the least well-known of the three, but it has been gaining popularity over the last \ndecade.\n\nUnder this structure, the insurance company is owned by its policyholders and managed by a third party known as an \nattorney-in-fact. The attorney-in-fact runs the company’s day-to-day operations, such as issuing policies and handling \nclaims. They also oversee the distribution of expenses based on the membership’s potential risks.\n\nDeFi primitives such as DAOs and capturing data on-chain provide the essential tools needed for coordination and \ntransparency. DeFi insurance provider [Ease](https://ease.org) follows Reciprocal Model to provide insurance to its \ncustomers."

          "details": "## Intro to Nexus Mutual\nNexus Mutual is a decentralized insurance platform that uses blockchain technology to create a risk-sharing pool in the form of a mutual. The platform is built on the Ethereum public chain and allows anyone to become a member and purchase cover. It replaces the idea of a traditional insurance company because it is wholly owned by the members. The model encourages engagement as members will get economic incentives for participating in risk assessment, claims assessment, and governance.\n\n## Membership Requirements\nBecoming a member of the NXM mutual gives you ownership rights to the assets of the company, and a one-time membership fee of 0.0020 ETH. In order to become a member, you will need to verify your identity using our Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process. The NXM token represents membership rights in the mutual, with all members owning the company together in proportion to their individual NXM holdings.\n\n## Risk Assessment and Staking\nMembers in Nexus Mutual can earn rewards for staking against the security of a protocol or custodian. This means that Nexus Mutual stakers may lose their stake if a successful claim is made against the security of a protocol or custodian. Therefore, staking with Nexus Mutual should be considered as active rather than passive staking.\n\n## Claim Assessment\nMembers who stake NXM act as claim assessors and decide whether to approve a claim. The claims are processed within 72 hours. For a claim that needs approval, the loss of funds must-\n\n1. Fall into various categories which are mentioned in the cover policy contract\n2. Occur within the defined time period\n3. Be significant enough to account for as a claim\n\nThe claimant must additionally provide evidence of their loss or that they were unable to withdraw money. This might be a 0-value transaction or a signature. An account statement, a notification from the protocol describing a hack, or another sort of warning could serve as additional proof.\n"

          "details": "Nexus Mutual consists of three types of covers-\n\n1. Protocol Covers \n2. Custody Cover \n3. Yield Token Cover\n\nCover is only ever applicable to specific types of events and is always protocol- or token-specific. A protocol cover policy, for instance, won't safeguard money held on a custodial platform. Cover is used as an alternative to “insurance” in traditional finance.\n\n### Protocol Covers\nProtocol covers are generally to protect and safeguards assets in the event of a protocol, smart contract failure, or oracle misuse. They are necessary because smart contacts can be hacked due to flaws in them. Primarily it includes-\n\n1. Economic design failure \n2. Governance attacks\n3. Severe oracle failure \n4. Protection for Non-Ethereum smart contracts\n5. Protection for assets on Layer-2\n\n### Custody Covers\nIn the case of an attack on a custodial platform—one that seizes custody of user cash when they engage with it—this kind of insurance protects that money. Cover the dangers of money being stolen or the withdrawal being stopped. Popular custodial platforms include Coinbase and BlockFi. \n\n### Yield Token Cover\nFunds are protected by yield token cover in the event that a yield token—a token included in a yield-generating protocol, like yDAI—loses its peg to its underlying asset and therefore loses some of its value. There is protection against yield token protocol failure or peg loss for Yearn, Convex, Idle USDT, and other cryptocurrencies.\n"

The cost of cover, which may also be purchased with ETH and DAI, can also be paid with NXM. Members can also take part in governance by casting NXM votes on ideas.

          "details": "\nSherlock is a code audit marketplace which also provides a kind of optional warranty on the audited code in the form of an insurance cover. They employ top  rated code auditors called “Watsons” to audit smart contracts of protocols on the blockchain. Once the code is audited, Sherlock gives the protocol the option  to warrant the audited code by buying an insurance cover for the total value locked in the audited smart contracts. Ideally, in the case of an attack on the audited  protocol smart contract, an insurance claim can be made by the protocol to cover for their losses. This is a multi step process, involving some terms and conditions  which will be discussed later.\n\nIn order to insure the audited smart contracts, Sherlock would need capital. Sherlock generates this capital by offering USDC staking in their application. The USDC  staking returns on Sherlock is one of the highest offered (11% APY), at the time of writing this guide. They provide this APY from a few streams, more on that later.  But note that in the event of a claim, upto 50% of the staked USDC can be slashed from the user. So it is a high risk- high reward investment. \nNow that we have a brief understanding of what Sherlock does, let us get into details of their working.\n \n"

          "details": "### Cover\n\nProtocols go to Sherlock to get their code audited. Once audited, the protocol can take the decision whether or not to opt for an insurance cover after conducting a bug  bounty program. Sherlock offers up to $5M in smart contract exploit coverage behind every audit (not included in audit cost), which can be activated at any point after the  audit is completed, provided there haven’t been subsequent changes to the code base.  \n\nOnce an agreement for the insurance cover and the insurance premium has been reached depending on whether the protocol wants to hold a public audit contest (2% premium) or a  private audit contest (2.25% premium). Sherlock then calculates how much USDC must be charged per second for the insurance premium. Sherlock requires a month or so of upfront  payment before coverage can be activated. After that, it's up to the protocol team to pay bi-weekly, monthly, etc. Sherlock will charge the protocol every second; that is, the  active balance of the protocol will keep reducing each second. Each protocol is required to maintain a minimum active balance of 500 USDC and 12 hours of minimum time of coverage l eft (which could theoretically mean more than 500 USDC depending on the size of the insurance cover). If a protocol falls below these requirements, it will be considered to have opted  out of the insurance policy. \n\nIn case sherlock does not have enough TVL to cover the insurance bought by a protocol, say the protocol is insured for 5 million USD but Sherlock only has 4 million TVL, then Sherlock  will not over-charge the protocol by charging them for a 4 million USD cover and not a 5 million USD cover.\n"

          "details": "### Staking\n\nUsers can deposit their USDC into Sherlock for fixed periods like 6 or 12 months. For this, they reward the user with USDC rewards and SHER rewards. SHER is the governance token of Sherlock  protocol. On staking, the user accepts the risk that up to 50% of their staked USDC could be slashed in the case of an attack (claim).\n\n### Rewards\n\nThe APY is generated for the user from three streams, * Premium paid by protocols * Yield generated by Sherlock by investing the staked USDC into protocols like Aave and Compound * SHER rewards\n\nThe first source may vary due to factors like lack of TVL in Sherlock which would mean that the protocols pay lesser premiums which inturn would affect staking APY, or a claim event which could also affect the APY. The second source is variable since the yield from investment cannot be predicted accurately nor is it stable.  The third source of rewards is fixed in terms of the amount of SHER token the user will receive, but is variable in the context that the SHER token’s value could be varying.\n\n### Unstaking and restaking\n\nAfter the lockup period has passed, a staker has the option to either unstake their position or restake their position. Either option will result in the owed SHER tokens being sent to the staker.\n\nAfter a staker's lockup period ends, they have two weeks to unstake their position. If they don't, their position will be automatically restaked for six months by an arbitrager. In return for paying the gas to  restake the position, the arbitrager will receive a portion of the stake's USDC. The reward for an arbitrager slowly increases over the course of a week, until it reaches the maximum reward rate of 20% of a staker's  USDC position. The SHER token rewards from the recent lockup period are still sent to the original staker, not the arbitrager. Note that users can only unstake their funds once the lockup period is over, unlike in  some DeFis where the user can unstake their tokens at will for some fee.\n\n \n"

          "details": "### SHER \nSHER is Sherlock’s governance token, it is distributed to the users as reward for staking their USDC in Sherlock. The distribution of the SHER token follows the following curve. The SHER distribution rate will  start at a maximum when the TVL in Sherlock is zero and maintain constant until Sherlock reaches a certain TVL (a), after this point, the SHER distribution rate reduces linearly and eventually reaches zero at a  target TVL (b), beyond (b) no SHER will be distributed. \n\nThe same curve is used for every staking period and the period is used as a multiplier. This will result in the same APY for every staking period. Meaning, if the same amount of USDC is staked at the same point in  time but one for 6 months and another for 12, the 12 month stake will yield twice the amount of SHER. But it cannot be said that staking the same amount of USDC for 6 months twice will yield the same amount of SHER  as staking it for 12 months at once since the SHER rate might have changed after the first 6 months in the former case.\n\nThe purpose of this curve is to ensure that Sherlock's TVL never falls below a certain level. If the current TVL changes, the starting point on the curve moves more to the left if the TVL drops and more to the right  if the TVL increases. SHER rewards are automatically increased (on a TVL drop) or decreased (on a TVL increase) as the point on the slope changes.\n"

          "details": "### Claim submission\n\nIf an exploit is thought to have occurred at a covered protocol, the protocol can submit a claim to Sherlock. Sherlock's Watsons will first work alongside the core devs to mitigate the exploit if it is still live. Once the exploit has been mitigated, the Watsons will work to understand the exploit's cause and magnitude. Through this process, a protocol will have a good sense of whether the exploit experienced is covered by Sherlock, and thus a claim should be submitted. The Watsons will help with the general claim submission process as well as choosing the correct timestamp and amount that should be submitted.\n\n### Claim evaluation\n\nFirst, the claim is evaluated by the SPCC (Sherlock Protocol Claims Committee) if happy with their verdict, the claim process ends here.\n\nIf unhappy with SPCC’s verdict the protocol can either,  revise the amount of claim and resubmit   escalate the claim to the UMA optimistic oracle\nTo escalate the claim to the UMA Optimistic Oracle. The covered protocol is required to “stake” a reasonable claim amount,  to escalate the claim above the SPCC, computed as follows: \n\n``Staked amount = 2 x (Sherlock's bond of 9600 USDC + UMA's final fee)``\n\nThe escalation of the claim would move the decision-making process from Sherlock's hands into the hands of UMA's Optimistic Oracle. The  claims decision would be voted on by UMA tokenholders using UMA's Data Verification Mechanism, and the resolution of that vote would be binding.  If the covered protocol is proven correct, then the amount specified in the claim will be paid out to Sherlock. They will also receive the staked amount,  minus UMA's burned amount (half of Sherlock's bond of 9600 USDC + UMA's final fee). If the covered protocol's escalation is not successful, then the amount specified by  the claim is not paid out and the stake amount is not returned.\n\n### Claim payment \n\nWhen a claim has been made and it has gone through successfully, Sherlock will cover the amount using the USDC staked in their application. Each covered protocol will have a policy that is targeted to be 50% or  less of the total Sherlock staking pool. This ensures that any single exploit event an any single protocol can cause a payout for a maximum of 50% of the staking pool. More than 50% of the staking pool can be used  for a payout if multiple covered protocols experience covered hacks in a short timeframe.\n\nHowever, if the size of the exploit (specifically the funds lost) is smaller than the total coverage amount at a protocol, the size of the payout will be a fraction of the 50% maximum. Also, if an exploit becomes possible  on multiple protocols due to a chain bug (i.e. a bug in Ethereum L1), then no more than 50% of the staking pool can be used to repay those exploits, even if individual protocols had policies that aggregate to a sum that is  larger than 50% of the staking pool.\n"
