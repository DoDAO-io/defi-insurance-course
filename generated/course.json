      "details": "Insurance in decentralized finance (DeFi) works in much the same way as traditional insurance, with a few key differences. In traditional insurance, a policyholder pays premiums to an insurance company, which provides financial protection in the event of a loss or other covered event. In DeFi, insurance is typically provided by a smart contract on a blockchain, rather than by a traditional insurance company.\nHere are some key points to consider when thinking about insurance in DeFi:\n* Risk pooling: DeFi insurance typically works by pooling the premiums paid by policyholders into a shared fund. This fund is used to pay out claims in the event of a loss or covered event.\n* Smart contracts: DeFi insurance is typically provided through smart contracts on a blockchain. These smart contracts automate the process of calculating premiums, paying out claims, and managing the risk pool.\n* Transparency: Because DeFi insurance is provided through smart contracts on a blockchain, the terms of the insurance policy and the status of the risk pool are typically transparent and verifiable. This can give policyholders more confidence in the fairness and reliability of the insurance process.\n* Customization: DeFi insurance can be customized to meet the specific needs of policyholders. For example, a policyholder might be able to choose the specific risks they want to be covered for, or select a premium payment schedule that meets their needs.\n* Overall, DeFi insurance is a promising new application of blockchain technology that has the potential to make insurance more transparent, efficient, and accessible.\n\n",

          "details": "## Rise of Crypto\nThe rise of blockchain and crypto currencies has brought about a number of changes in the technology and financial sector, which has in turn opened up the possibility - and need - for new types of organizations and products which did not exist before. \n\nWe've seen a lot of new, innovative ways to raise capital, align community interests, and make rewards or payments using a native currency. And on the human coordination front, we see that teams of hundreds or thousands of people can work together towards a common goal with aligned incentives. The members can choose to be completely anonymous. Blockchain Technology has made it easy to write small software programs (smart contracts) that can lay out completely flexible rules on how money can be collected or given out. \n\n## Need for DeFi Insurance\nThe DeFi market has been plagued by hacks, bugs, exploits, rug-pulls, and flash loan attacks since its early days, leading to a loss of confidence among users and preventing mainstream adoption. While technological maturity will reduce many of the vulnerabilities, it will not be able to make the system risk-proof. Insurance solutions can help protect users in these situations.\n\nIn most cases, the funds that users have stored in banks in developed nations are backed by the government. This means that if a bank were to go bankrupt, the government would cover the customer's losses up to a certain limit. A good insurance infrastructure is crucial for users of developed nations if we want them to use open blockchain technologies as their primary way of interacting with the financial ecosystem.\n\n## Current State of DeFi Insurance\nAs of the start of 2023, the total value locked in the DeFi ecosystem is about ~$52 billion with an all-time high of about ~250 billion in January of 2022. (Source: DeFi Llama). DeFi insurance makes up less than 1% of total TVL in DeFi. In insurance, we see ~210 million TLV and out of that, ~170 million of TVL is represented by Nexus Mutual.\n\nAdoption of DeFi applications has been growing rapidly in recent months, with lending & borrowing and exchanges being the two most popular categories. One of the main reasons for their popularity is that most of the functionality provided by these projects is purely code and algorithm driven, which removes the need for a middleman and makes the entire system more transparent, trustable and efficient.\n\nOn the other hand, even though DeFi insurance still requires human intervention when it comes to filing and evaluating claims, we will see more and more trustable, code-driven decisions being made about claims in the coming years."

          "shortTitle": "Working",
          "details": "## Current problems with Insurance Industry\nOne of the best things about developed nations is that most of the users can trustable insurance for companies which protects them from unexpected events. Strong financial and insurance system is must for any country to prosper. \n\nAn insurer offers guaranteed support in case of emergency/unforeseen circumstances, and in exchange they charge premium to the customers. Interests of the insurer and the insured are completely opposite i.e. and insurer would want to payout minimal claims and get maximum insurance premiums, but an insured would want to get maximum coverage with minimal premium. \n\nThere are many problems faced by by insurance companies\n1) **Misaligned incentives** -   2) **Capital Requirements** - The insurance industry is a capital-intensive\n   business. The more capital you have, the more people you can insure, and the\n   more premiums you can get. This in turn reduces your risk and allows you to\n   charge lower premiums to customers. However, this creates a chicken-and-egg\n   problem for smaller startups. They can't easily enter the industry because\n   of the high capital requirements and economies of scale. This lack of\n   competition means higher premiums for customers.\n\n\n3) **Inefficiencies** -  The insurance industry, like the banking sector, is\n   highly regulated. This can make it difficult for new, innovative companies\n   to enter the market. And because the bigger players rely on outdated\n   technologies and processes, they can be quite inefficient. This inefficiency\n   leads to higher premiums for customers.\n\n   However, with real-time analytics and reporting, most of the regulation can be simplified and made \n   real-time. This would lead to better use of technology, reduced costs for entrance into the industry, \n   and improved day-to-day operations.\n\n4) **Transparency** - \nAn insurer is looking after customers money and then promising it will pay when a claim arises. As a result, the insurer is becoming an agent of the customer and history has proven this model doesn’t\nwork without heavy oversight from government institutions and complex legal frameworks. These frameworks are necessary primarily due to the lack of trust between customers and the institution and boil down to two main points:\n\n\n\n\n## Law of Large Numbers\nInsurance companies use the law of large numbers to estimate the losses a certain group of insureds may have in the future. For example, using statistics, an Actuary looks at losses that have occurred in the past and predicts that in the future approximately two out of 100 policyholders will have a claim. Thus, if the company writes 100 automobile policies, it may expect to pay two claims. This is referred to as loss frequency.\n\nInsurers must also determine the average cost of claims over time, or loss severity. If the average claim resulted in the company paying $1,000, then the Actuary will predict that total losses for the upcoming year will be $2,000 (two claims at $1,000 each).\n\nThe law of large numbers states that as the number of policyholders increases, the more confident the insurance company is its prediction will prove true. Therefore, they attempt to acquire a large number of similar policyholders who all contribute to a fund which will pay the losses.\n\n## How premiums are calculated\nInsurers use risk data to calculate the likelihood of the event you are insuring against happening. This information is used to work out the cost of your premium. The more likely the event you are insuring against is to occur, the higher the risk to the insurer and, as a result, the higher the cost of your premium.\n\nAn insurer will take two important factors into account when working out the premium they will charge.\n\nHow likely is it in general terms that someone will need to make a claim?\nIs the person who wants to take out a policy a bigger or smaller risk than the ‘average’ policyholder (for example, a young person with a high-powered car may be charged a higher premium as they are statistically more likely to be involved in an accident than a mature, experienced driver)?\nOnly a proportion of policyholders will make a claim in any one year.

          "details": "## Cover Providers\nInstead of purchasing coverage from a centralized entity, DeFi insurance protocols allow users and companies to \npurchase coverage from a decentralized pool of coverage providers. Anyone can be a coverage provider by locking \ncapital in a capital pool and exposing themselves to risk, just as liquidity providers do in lending protocols. \nCover providers invest their funds in pools with higher returns relative to the protocol's risk, which means that \nindividuals trade the outcomes of events based on their estimations of the probability of the underlying risk event. \nIf a protocol covered by the insurer suffers an adverse event such as a hack, the funds in the capital pool that covers \nthat protocol will be used to compensate users who purchased coverage against that specific event on that protocol. \nCoverage providers are incentivized to provide liquidity and are rewarded for assuming risk by earning a return on \ntheir capital. The yield is a percentage of premiums paid, presenting a correlation between the premium paid and \nthe risk for the protocol under consideration. However, DeFi insurers often include their own liquidity mining \nincentives in their yield calculation, which are used to bootstrap liquidity for the pools.\n\n",

          "details": "## Insurance Policy Components\nWhen choosing a policy, it is important to understand how insurance works.\n\nA firm understanding of these concepts goes a long way in helping you choose the policy that best suits your needs. For instance, whole life insurance may or may not be the right type of life insurance for you. Three components of any type of insurance are crucial: premium, policy limit, and deductible.\n\n### Premium\nA policy’s premium is its price, typically expressed as a monthly cost. The premium is determined by the insurer based on your or your business’s risk profile, which may include creditworthiness.\n\nFor example, if you own several expensive automobiles and have a history of reckless driving, you will likely pay more for an auto policy than someone with a single midrange sedan and a perfect driving record. However, different insurers may charge different premiums for similar policies. So finding the price that is right for you requires some legwork.\n\n\n### Policy Limit\nThe policy limit is the maximum amount that an insurer will pay under a policy for a covered loss. Maximums may be set per period (e.g., annual or policy term), per loss or injury, or over the life of the policy, also known as the lifetime maximum.\n\nTypically, higher limits carry higher premiums. For a general life insurance policy, the maximum amount that the insurer will pay is referred to as the face value, which is the amount paid to a beneficiary upon the death of the insured.\n\n### Deductible\nThe deductible is a specific amount that the policyholder must pay out of pocket before the insurer pays a claim. Deductibles serve as deterrents to large volumes of small and insignificant claims.\n\nDeductibles can apply per policy or per claim, depending on the insurer and the type of policy. Policies with very high deductibles are typically less expensive because the high out-of-pocket expense generally results in fewer small claims.",

Its Total Value Locked (TVL) as of 1 May 2021 is $450 million, as opposed to $7 million for Cover Protocol, the second-largest Defi insurance protocol. Hugh Karp, a former CFO of Munich Re in the UK, launched Nexus Mutual.\n\nNexus Mutual is a decentralized protocol that enables organizations and people to buy insurance policies that guard against the particular risks associated with platforms that are decentralized (DeFi) or centralized (CeFi). Without the need for a centralized insurance provider, Nexus Mutual is an Ethereum-based platform that enables users from all over the world to share insurance risks. The members of the Nexus Mutual platform decide whether claims are legitimate, and smart contracts record and enforce their choices. This eliminates the need to have faith in an insurance company because claim payments are enforced by token-driven economic incentives. All mutual members have legal agreements supporting their membership rights, represented by cryptocurrency tokens used throughout the insurance platform.\n"

A protocol cover policy, for instance, won't safeguard money held on a custodial platform. Cover is used as an alternative to “insurance” in traditional finance.\n\n### Protocol Covers\nProtocol covers are generally to protect and safeguards assets in the event of a protocol, smart contract failure, or oracle misuse. They are necessary because smart contacts can be hacked due to flaws in them. Primarily it includes-\n\n1. Economic design failure \n2. Governance attacks\n3. Severe oracle failure \n4. Protection for Non-Ethereum smart contracts\n5. Protection for assets on Layer-2\n\n### Custody Covers\nIn the case of an attack on a custodial platform—one that seizes custody of user cash when they engage with it—this kind of insurance protects that money. Cover the dangers of money being stolen or the withdrawal being stopped. Popular custodial platforms include Coinbase and BlockFi. \n\n### Yield Token Cover\nFunds are protected by yield token cover in the event that a yield token—a token included in a yield-generating protocol, like yDAI—loses its peg to its underlying asset and therefore loses some of its value. There is protection against yield token protocol failure or peg loss for Yearn, Convex, Idle USDT, and other cryptocurrencies.\n"

It offers smart contract hacks, CeFi exchange hacks, stablecoin depegs, oracle failures, and allows users to create Capital Pools in which capital providers deposit ETH and their risk exposure is restricted to a single insurance policy. There are also structured insurance products called Capital Buckets that spread risk over a number of insurance contracts.\n"

Users are safeguarded in six centralised exchanges (loss of money policy), two wallets, eight decentralised applications (DApps), the Chainlink Oracle (oracle failure policy), Lido Finance (slashing protection policy), three custodians, and four peg loss-related precautions. The default maximum exposure may be raised by the DAO by 5% per insurance capacity of the policy.\n"

Unslashed takes into account the correlations between policies that are a part of the same Capital Buckets in addition to a fair pricing approach that is applied to each policy or policy type. As with conventional actuarial pricing, the pricing also takes loss distributions into consideration. The most current rules allow the premium to change depending on the usage ratio because they include a supply and demand curve.\n\nUnslashed Developers were able to construct and calibrate models that enable the platform to fairly price risk and structure insurance products by bringing on board quants from traditional finance. All of these models are private, thus trust is necessary because they all come with inherent hazards.\n"

This typically offers insurance against a stablecoin's market price deviating from its target value by an amount greater than a predetermined threshold.\n\n### Custody Cover\nProtection against losses resulting from the use of a centralized or custodial (CeFi) cryptocurrency product (e.g. Coinbase, BlockFi). Typically this offers protection against custodian exploits and/or hacks, fund mismanagement and account lock-ups (inability to access funds without prior notification from the custodian).\n"

The Cover Buyers in the same asset pay these premiums (ETH). Instead, if someone chooses to deposit money into Capital Buckets, they can earn more yield categories, including premiums, income from asset management, and rewards from USF capital mining. Since USF is just being compensated for contributing capital and has no additional benefit, sell pressure is generated, which causes the token value to continuously drop.\n"

The claimant receives the desired payment if the claim is not contested. In the event that the claim is contested, Kleros, a decentralised third-party arbitration agency, is contacted. After reviewing the claimant's proof and cover letter, a third-party jury within Kleros determines whether to accept, reject, or refuse to consider the claim (majority vote decides). The claimant receives the amount sought, the claim deposit, and the challenger's deposit less arbitration fees if the claim is approved by Kleros.\n\nIf the jury declines to render a decision both the claimant and the challenger will have their deposits back and the arbitration fees will be shared. The sum demanded by the claimant is not granted. There is no cap on the number of times a claim may be appealed through Kleros, however, it's crucial to understand that the cost of appeal increases with each Kleros appeal. If the claim is ultimately rejected by a Kleros arbitration, it may be resubmitted once via the Unslashed dApp.\n"
