      "details": "Insurance in decentralized finance (DeFi) works in much the same way as traditional insurance, with a few key differences. In traditional insurance, a policyholder pays premiums to an insurance company, which provides financial protection in the event of a loss or other covered event. In DeFi, insurance is typically provided by a smart contract on a blockchain, rather than by a traditional insurance company.\nHere are some key points to consider when thinking about insurance in DeFi:\n* Risk pooling: DeFi insurance typically works by pooling the premiums paid by policyholders into a shared fund. This fund is used to pay out claims in the event of a loss or covered event.\n* Smart contracts: DeFi insurance is typically provided through smart contracts on a blockchain. These smart contracts automate the process of calculating premiums, paying out claims, and managing the risk pool.\n* Transparency: Because DeFi insurance is provided through smart contracts on a blockchain, the terms of the insurance policy and the status of the risk pool are typically transparent and verifiable. This can give policyholders more confidence in the fairness and reliability of the insurance process.\n* Customization: DeFi insurance can be customized to meet the specific needs of policyholders. For example, a policyholder might be able to choose the specific risks they want to be covered for, or select a premium payment schedule that meets their needs.\n* Overall, DeFi insurance is a promising new application of blockchain technology that has the potential to make insurance more transparent, efficient, and accessible.\n\n",

          "details": "Nexus Mutual is the most significant Defi insurance protocol in the cryptocurrency market. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) as of 1 May 2021 is $450 million, as opposed to $7 million for Cover Protocol, the second-largest Defi insurance protocol. Hugh Karp, a former CFO of Munich Re in the UK, launched Nexus Mutual.\n\nNexus Mutual is a decentralized protocol that enables organizations and people to buy insurance policies that guard against the particular risks associated with platforms that are decentralized (DeFi) or centralized (CeFi). Without the need for a centralized insurance provider, Nexus Mutual is an Ethereum-based platform that enables users from all over the world to share insurance risks. The members of the Nexus Mutual platform decide whether claims are legitimate, and smart contracts record and enforce their choices. This eliminates the need to have faith in an insurance company because claim payments are enforced by token-driven economic incentives. All mutual members have legal agreements supporting their membership rights, represented by cryptocurrency tokens used throughout the insurance platform.\n"

          "details": "Nexus Mutual consists of three types of covers-\n\n1. Protocol Covers \n2. Custody Cover \n3. Yield Token Cover\n\nCover is only ever applicable to specific types of events and is always protocol- or token-specific. A protocol cover policy, for instance, won't safeguard money held on a custodial platform. Cover is used as an alternative to “insurance” in traditional finance.\n\n### Protocol Covers\nProtocol covers are generally to protect and safeguards assets in the event of a protocol, smart contract failure, or oracle misuse. They are necessary because smart contacts can be hacked due to flaws in them. Primarily it includes-\n\n1. Economic design failure \n2. Governance attacks\n3. Severe oracle failure \n4. Protection for Non-Ethereum smart contracts\n5. Protection for assets on Layer-2\n\n### Custody Covers\nIn the case of an attack on a custodial platform—one that seizes custody of user cash when they engage with it—this kind of insurance protects that money. Cover the dangers of money being stolen or the withdrawal being stopped. Popular custodial platforms include Coinbase and BlockFi. \n\n### Yield Token Cover\nFunds are protected by yield token cover in the event that a yield token—a token included in a yield-generating protocol, like yDAI—loses its peg to its underlying asset and therefore loses some of its value. There is protection against yield token protocol failure or peg loss for Yearn, Convex, Idle USDT, and other cryptocurrencies.\n"

The cost of cover, which may also be purchased with ETH and DAI, can also be paid with NXM. Members can also take part in governance by casting NXM votes on ideas.
