      "details": "Insurance in decentralized finance (DeFi) works in much the same way as traditional insurance, with a few key differences. In traditional insurance, a policyholder pays premiums to an insurance company, which provides financial protection in the event of a loss or other covered event. In DeFi, insurance is typically provided by a smart contract on a blockchain, rather than by a traditional insurance company.\nHere are some key points to consider when thinking about insurance in DeFi:\n* Risk pooling: DeFi insurance typically works by pooling the premiums paid by policyholders into a shared fund. This fund is used to pay out claims in the event of a loss or covered event.\n* Smart contracts: DeFi insurance is typically provided through smart contracts on a blockchain. These smart contracts automate the process of calculating premiums, paying out claims, and managing the risk pool.\n* Transparency: Because DeFi insurance is provided through smart contracts on a blockchain, the terms of the insurance policy and the status of the risk pool are typically transparent and verifiable. This can give policyholders more confidence in the fairness and reliability of the insurance process.\n* Customization: DeFi insurance can be customized to meet the specific needs of policyholders. For example, a policyholder might be able to choose the specific risks they want to be covered for, or select a premium payment schedule that meets their needs.\n* Overall, DeFi insurance is a promising new application of blockchain technology that has the potential to make insurance more transparent, efficient, and accessible.\n\n",

          "details": "How Insurance Works\n\nHow Insurance Works\n\n\n## Law of Large Numbers\nInsurance companies use the law of large numbers to estimate the losses a certain group of insureds may have in the future. For example, using statistics, an Actuary looks at losses that have occurred in the past and predicts that in the future approximately two out of 100 policyholders will have a claim. Thus, if the company writes 100 automobile policies, it may expect to pay two claims. This is referred to as loss frequency.\n\nInsurers must also determine the average cost of claims over time, or loss severity. If the average claim resulted in the company paying $1,000, then the Actuary will predict that total losses for the upcoming year will be $2,000 (two claims at $1,000 each).\n\nThe law of large numbers states that as the number of policyholders increases, the more confident the insurance company is its prediction will prove true. Therefore, they attempt to acquire a large number of similar policyholders who all contribute to a fund which will pay the losses.\n\n## How premiums are calculated\nInsurers use risk data to calculate the likelihood of the event you are insuring against happening. This information is used to work out the cost of your premium. The more likely the event you are insuring against is to occur, the higher the risk to the insurer and, as a result, the higher the cost of your premium.\n\nAn insurer will take two important factors into account when working out the premium they will charge.\n\nHow likely is it in general terms that someone will need to make a claim?\nIs the person who wants to take out a policy a bigger or smaller risk than the ‘average’ policyholder (for example, a young person with a high-powered car may be charged a higher premium as they are statistically more likely to be involved in an accident than a mature, experienced driver)?\nOnly a proportion of policyholders will make a claim in any one year.

          "details": "## Cover Providers\nInstead of purchasing coverage from a centralized entity, DeFi insurance protocols allow users and companies to \npurchase coverage from a decentralized pool of coverage providers. Anyone can be a coverage provider by locking \ncapital in a capital pool and exposing themselves to risk, just as liquidity providers do in lending protocols. \nCover providers invest their funds in pools with higher returns relative to the protocol's risk, which means that \nindividuals trade the outcomes of events based on their estimations of the probability of the underlying risk event. \nIf a protocol covered by the insurer suffers an adverse event such as a hack, the funds in the capital pool that covers \nthat protocol will be used to compensate users who purchased coverage against that specific event on that protocol. \nCoverage providers are incentivized to provide liquidity and are rewarded for assuming risk by earning a return on \ntheir capital. The yield is a percentage of premiums paid, presenting a correlation between the premium paid and \nthe risk for the protocol under consideration. However, DeFi insurers often include their own liquidity mining \nincentives in their yield calculation, which are used to bootstrap liquidity for the pools.\n\n",

          "details": "## Insurance Policy Components\nWhen choosing a policy, it is important to understand how insurance works.\n\nA firm understanding of these concepts goes a long way in helping you choose the policy that best suits your needs. For instance, whole life insurance may or may not be the right type of life insurance for you. Three components of any type of insurance are crucial: premium, policy limit, and deductible.\n\n### Premium\nA policy’s premium is its price, typically expressed as a monthly cost. The premium is determined by the insurer based on your or your business’s risk profile, which may include creditworthiness.\n\nFor example, if you own several expensive automobiles and have a history of reckless driving, you will likely pay more for an auto policy than someone with a single midrange sedan and a perfect driving record. However, different insurers may charge different premiums for similar policies. So finding the price that is right for you requires some legwork.\n\n\n### Policy Limit\nThe policy limit is the maximum amount that an insurer will pay under a policy for a covered loss. Maximums may be set per period (e.g., annual or policy term), per loss or injury, or over the life of the policy, also known as the lifetime maximum.\n\nTypically, higher limits carry higher premiums. For a general life insurance policy, the maximum amount that the insurer will pay is referred to as the face value, which is the amount paid to a beneficiary upon the death of the insured.\n\n### Deductible\nThe deductible is a specific amount that the policyholder must pay out of pocket before the insurer pays a claim. Deductibles serve as deterrents to large volumes of small and insignificant claims.\n\nDeductibles can apply per policy or per claim, depending on the insurer and the type of policy. Policies with very high deductibles are typically less expensive because the high out-of-pocket expense generally results in fewer small claims.",

Its Total Value Locked (TVL) as of 1 May 2021 is $450 million, as opposed to $7 million for Cover Protocol, the second-largest Defi insurance protocol. Hugh Karp, a former CFO of Munich Re in the UK, launched Nexus Mutual.\n\nNexus Mutual is a decentralized protocol that enables organizations and people to buy insurance policies that guard against the particular risks associated with platforms that are decentralized (DeFi) or centralized (CeFi). Without the need for a centralized insurance provider, Nexus Mutual is an Ethereum-based platform that enables users from all over the world to share insurance risks. The members of the Nexus Mutual platform decide whether claims are legitimate, and smart contracts record and enforce their choices. This eliminates the need to have faith in an insurance company because claim payments are enforced by token-driven economic incentives. All mutual members have legal agreements supporting their membership rights, represented by cryptocurrency tokens used throughout the insurance platform.\n"

Cover is used as an alternative to “insurance” in traditional finance.\n\n### Protocol Covers\nProtocol covers are generally to protect and safeguards assets in the event of a protocol, smart contract failure, or oracle misuse. They are necessary because smart contacts can be hacked due to flaws in them. Primarily it includes-\n\n1. Economic design failure \n2. Governance attacks\n3. Severe oracle failure \n4. Protection for Non-Ethereum smart contracts\n5. Protection for assets on Layer-2\n\n### Custody Covers\nIn the case of an attack on a custodial platform—one that seizes custody of user cash when they engage with it—this kind of insurance protects that money. Cover the dangers of money being stolen or the withdrawal being stopped. Popular custodial platforms include Coinbase and BlockFi. \n\n### Yield Token Cover\nFunds are protected by yield token cover in the event that a yield token—a token included in a yield-generating protocol, like yDAI—loses its peg to its underlying asset and therefore loses some of its value. There is protection against yield token protocol failure or peg loss for Yearn, Convex, Idle USDT, and other cryptocurrencies.\n"
