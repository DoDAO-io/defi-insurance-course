      "details": "Insurance in decentralized finance (DeFi) works in much the same way as traditional insurance, with a few key differences. In traditional insurance, a policyholder pays premiums to an insurance company, which provides financial protection in the event of a loss or other covered event. In DeFi, insurance is typically provided by a smart contract on a blockchain, rather than by a traditional insurance company.\nHere are some key points to consider when thinking about insurance in DeFi:\n* Risk pooling: DeFi insurance typically works by pooling the premiums paid by policyholders into a shared fund. This fund is used to pay out claims in the event of a loss or covered event.\n* Smart contracts: DeFi insurance is typically provided through smart contracts on a blockchain. These smart contracts automate the process of calculating premiums, paying out claims, and managing the risk pool.\n* Transparency: Because DeFi insurance is provided through smart contracts on a blockchain, the terms of the insurance policy and the status of the risk pool are typically transparent and verifiable. This can give policyholders more confidence in the fairness and reliability of the insurance process.\n* Customization: DeFi insurance can be customized to meet the specific needs of policyholders. For example, a policyholder might be able to choose the specific risks they want to be covered for, or select a premium payment schedule that meets their needs.\n* Overall, DeFi insurance is a promising new application of blockchain technology that has the potential to make insurance more transparent, efficient, and accessible.\n\n",

          "details": "## Background \nInsurance is one of the most important things to have in order to feel secure financially. A good insurance policy can  give someone peace of mind and the freedom to not have to worry about losing everything they've worked for in the event  of an accident or other unforeseen circumstance. In developed nations, a good insurance framework protects people from  having to worry about their health, their life, and their material possessions like their car, house, or business in  the event of an unexpected event.\n\nInsurance companies have been around for many years, but not a lot has changed in how they operate. In fact, trust in  these companies has been decreasing every year. Insurance is a type of industry that requires a lot of money to get  started, which prevents startups from entering the space and thus preventing any real change or innovation in the  insurance industry.  \n\n## Challenges with Traditional Insurance \nThere are a few key issues that need to be addressed within the insurance industry: \n1) The relationship between insurance companies and their customers is adversarial - meaning that companies profit more when customers make fewer claims. \n2) There is a lack of trust because insurance contracts are often complex and designed to protect the organization rather than the customer. \n3) ~30-40% of capital goes towards operational expenses.  \n4) High capital requirements makes it difficult for startups to join the industry, which in turn stifles innovation. \n5) Core insurance business models are decades old and have seen little innovation in recent years.\n6) The insurance industry is notoriously slow-moving and risk-averse, which has resulted in many sectors being left out and not enjoying the benefits of insurance.",

          "details": "## DeFi and Insurance \nBlockchain and DeFi are not just about transferring tokens from one person to another - they offer a lot of new finance  primitives that have changed how finance companies operate. Some of the new innovations in DeFi that relate to the  insurance industry include ...\n\n### 1. Raising Capital \nTokenization and mechanisms like bonding curves and staking have made it easier to raise capital. These new innovative  methods reward early investors who take risks and believe in the vision.\n\nFor example, when using a bonding curve to raise funds, people who invest at an earlier stage can get more tokens than  those investing at later stages.\n\n### 2. Aligning Interests \nToken models create flexiblity and allows protocols/projects to use innovative methods to ensure that everyone's  interests are aligned with common goals. For example, some of the most prominent functions in an insurance company  are claims assessment, treasury management, and underwriting. By adding rewards and penalizing wrong behavior, it  will bring interests closer together to achieve common goals.\n\nMoreover, different types of distribution models for tokens usually have a preference for long-term token holders  who have confidence in the project as opposed to those who are only focused on short-term token prices.\n\n### 3. New Coordination Models \nCoordination models enabled by DeFi and DAO have opened up opportunities for new types of organizations, in which  members may not even know one another's identities, but can still work together effectively. \n\nIn traditional organizations, decisions are made by top management, and all employees work towards meeting those  goals. In DAOs, teams vote on proposals in a democratic way. This gives members a voice, as anyone can create and  submit proposals, and by voting the community develops a sense of collective ownership.\n\nWe are still in the experimental stage when it comes to DAOs, but we are already seeing that they can be much more  efficient than traditional organizations in many ways.\n\n### 4. Customer and Insurance Company on same side \nIn traditional insurance companies, the relationship between the company and its customers is usually one where they're  against each other. This is because in order for the organization to grow, they need more funds which often comes from  raising prices or finding new customers. However, in the DeFi space most operations are handled by code which means  that the cost of serving 10,000 customers is pretty much the same as serving 100,000 customers. This provides an  incentive for DeFi projects to develop products that are relevant and achieve mass adoption.\n\nMost Decentralized Finance protocols share profits among participants, and allow anyone to participate. This allows  customers to also participate and become stakeholders in the success of the protocol. This helps to create a sense of  ownership and responsibility among those using the protocol, and it also encourages continued usage and engagement as  users will want to see the project they're a part of succeed.\n\n### 5. Transparency \nHow confident would you be in your insurance provider if you knew their total funds, profit margins, exact formula for  calculating premiums, and day-to-day operations? This is how most DeFi protocols operate.\n\nBy having data on the blockchain, anyone can query it and see how it has changed over time. This develops confidence and also enables people outside the organization to provide critical feedback and insights.  You can see all the major data points for the leading DeFi insurance provider - Nexus Mutual - [here](https://nexustracker.io/) \n\n### 6. Innovation \n\nTraditional insurance companies are hamstrung by bureaucracy and are slow to address newer, unestablished sectors.  However, the composable nature of DeFi primitives enables rapid innovation and offers new business models that are  not available in traditional insurance companies.\n\nFor example, the crypto industry currently holds around $800 billion, but only a tiny percentage of that is insured.  Now there are a few DeFi insurance companies that offer crypto insurance which includes smart contract exploits, loss  of funds etc. This provides a much needed service for the rapidly growing crypto industry.",

          "details": "We will be discussing some of the new business models we see in DeFi insurance protocols below. We will also be \ndiscussing each of the DeFi Insurance Protocols in detail separately.\n\n### Mutual or Cooperatives\nBefore insurance companies came into existence, communities would band together and pool resources in order to \nprotect individual members from risks they all faced. If an unfortunate event occurred, the senior members of the \ncommunity would decide whether or not to provide assistance. All funds raised were used to benefit the members of \nthe community.\n\nStarting a mutual or cooperative can be complicated and expensive, with legal fees often running into the tens of \nthousands of dollars.There are also many other challenges that exist in cooperatives, such as taking common decisions, \nvoting, and rewarding active participants over inactive members. The recent DAO movement in cryptocurrency is trying \nto address many of these solutions and offers software solutions for many of these problems.\n\nNexusMutual is the most prominent DeFi insurance protocol, and it takes a cooperative approach to business. To \nparticipate or buy insurance cover, one must be a member of the mutual. With this business model, both the cover \nproviders and insurance cover buyers work towards the success of the protocol.\n\nThis approach ensures that everyone has a vested interest in the success of the protocol, and that everyone is working \ntogether to make it successful. This cooperative approach is what makes NexusMutual different from traditional \ninsurance providers.\n\n### Provide Warranty(Assurance)\nBigger companies have the advantage when it comes to offering warranties for their products and services. If a customer \nis dissatisfied with a purchase, they can receive a refund or some other form of compensation. This makes it difficult \nfor smaller businesses to compete in the same market.\n\nTokenization can help startups by providing interesting models that solve problems related to the product or service \nwarranties. For example, a startup could ask investors to stake some funds to help offset the risk of a warranty, and \nin return the startup would reward them with a portion of the premiums. This is somewhat similar to how public \ninsurance companies work, where the profits go to shareholders. However, DeFi provides a lot more flexibility \nto investors, allowing them to invest and then earn based on their knowledge and risk appetite.\n\nIn one of the sections, we will discuss the Sherlock protocol in detail. This protocol offers companies warranties against \nany funds loss that may occur as a result of security exploits in the code that has been audited.\n\n### Reciprocal Insurance\nThere are three primary ways to structure an insurance company: the stock model, the mutual model, and the reciprocal \nmodel. The reciprocal model is the least well-known of the three, but it has been gaining popularity over the last \ndecade.\n\nUnder this structure, the insurance company is owned by its policyholders and managed by a third party known as an \nattorney-in-fact. The attorney-in-fact runs the company’s day-to-day operations, such as issuing policies and handling \nclaims. They also oversee the distribution of expenses based on the membership’s potential risks.\n\nDeFi primitives such as DAOs and capturing data on-chain provide the essential tools needed for coordination and \ntransparency. DeFi insurance provider [Ease](https://ease.org) follows Reciprocal Model to provide insurance to its \ncustomers.",

          "details": "## Intro to Nexus Mutual\nNexus Mutual is a decentralized insurance platform that uses blockchain technology to create a risk-sharing pool in the form of a mutual. The platform is built on the Ethereum public chain and allows anyone to become a member and purchase cover. It replaces the idea of a traditional insurance company because it is wholly owned by the members. The model encourages engagement as members will get economic incentives for participating in risk assessment, claims assessment, and governance.\n\n## Membership Requirements\nBecoming a member of the NXM mutual gives you ownership rights to the assets of the company, and a one-time membership fee of 0.0020 ETH. In order to become a member, you will need to verify your identity using our Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process. The NXM token represents membership rights in the mutual, with all members owning the company together in proportion to their individual NXM holdings.\n\n## Risk Assessment and Staking\nMembers in Nexus Mutual can earn rewards for staking against the security of a protocol or custodian. This means that Nexus Mutual stakers may lose their stake if a successful claim is made against the security of a protocol or custodian. Therefore, staking with Nexus Mutual should be considered as active rather than passive staking.\n\n## Claim Assessment\nMembers who stake NXM act as claim assessors and decide whether to approve a claim. The claims are processed within 72 hours. For a claim that needs approval, the loss of funds must-\n\n1. Fall into various categories which are mentioned in the cover policy contract\n2. Occur within the defined time period\n3. Be significant enough to account for as a claim\n\nThe claimant must additionally provide evidence of their loss or that they were unable to withdraw money. This might be a 0-value transaction or a signature. An account statement, a notification from the protocol describing a hack, or another sort of warning could serve as additional proof.\n"

          "details": "Nexus Mutual consists of three types of covers-\n\n1. Protocol Covers \n2. Custody Cover \n3. Yield Token Cover\n\nCover is only ever applicable to specific types of events and is always protocol- or token-specific. A protocol cover policy, for instance, won't safeguard money held on a custodial platform. Cover is used as an alternative to “insurance” in traditional finance.\n\n### Protocol Covers\nProtocol covers are generally to protect and safeguards assets in the event of a protocol, smart contract failure, or oracle misuse. They are necessary because smart contacts can be hacked due to flaws in them. Primarily it includes-\n\n1. Economic design failure \n2. Governance attacks\n3. Severe oracle failure \n4. Protection for Non-Ethereum smart contracts\n5. Protection for assets on Layer-2\n\n### Custody Covers\nIn the case of an attack on a custodial platform—one that seizes custody of user cash when they engage with it—this kind of insurance protects that money. Cover the dangers of money being stolen or the withdrawal being stopped. Popular custodial platforms include Coinbase and BlockFi. \n\n### Yield Token Cover\nFunds are protected by yield token cover in the event that a yield token—a token included in a yield-generating protocol, like yDAI—loses its peg to its underlying asset and therefore loses some of its value. There is protection against yield token protocol failure or peg loss for Yearn, Convex, Idle USDT, and other cryptocurrencies.\n"

The cost of cover, which may also be purchased with ETH and DAI, can also be paid with NXM. Members can also take part in governance by casting NXM votes on ideas.
