    ## Rise of Crypto

    The rise of blockchain and crypto currencies has brought about a number of
    changes in the technology and financial sector, which has in turn opened up
    the possibility - and need - for new types of organizations and products
    which did not exist before. 


    We've seen a lot of new, innovative ways to raise capital, align community
    interests, and make rewards or payments using a native currency. And on the
    human coordination front, we see that teams of hundreds or thousands of
    people can work together towards a common goal with aligned incentives. The
    members can choose to be completely anonymous. Blockchain Technology has
    made it easy to write small software programs (smart contracts) that can lay
    out completely flexible rules on how money can be collected or given out. 


    ## Need for DeFi Insurance

    The DeFi market has been plagued by hacks, bugs, exploits, rug-pulls, and
    flash loan attacks since its early days, leading to a loss of confidence
    among users and preventing mainstream adoption. While technological maturity
    will reduce many of the vulnerabilities, it will not be able to make the
    system risk-proof. Insurance solutions can help protect users in these
    situations.


    In most cases, the funds that users have stored in banks in developed
    nations are backed by the government. This means that if a bank were to go
    bankrupt, the government would cover the customer's losses up to a certain
    limit. A good insurance infrastructure is crucial for users of developed
    nations if we want them to use open blockchain technologies as their primary
    way of interacting with the financial ecosystem.


    ## Current State of DeFi Insurance


    TLV of DeFi is about ~52 Billion 

    In Insurance we see ~210 Million TLV and out of that ~170 million is by
    Nexus Mutual.



    In the last three years i.e. since the inception of DeFi, most of the money
    that had been deployed in DeFi went towards Lending & Borrowing and
    Decentralized exchanges

    How Insurance Works


    How Insurance Works



    ## Law of Large Numbers

    Insurance companies use the law of large numbers to estimate the losses a
    certain group of insureds may have in the future. For example, using
    statistics, an Actuary looks at losses that have occurred in the past and
    predicts that in the future approximately two out of 100 policyholders will
    have a claim. Thus, if the company writes 100 automobile policies, it may
    expect to pay two claims. This is referred to as loss frequency.


    Insurers must also determine the average cost of claims over time, or loss
    severity. If the average claim resulted in the company paying $1,000, then
    the Actuary will predict that total losses for the upcoming year will be
    $2,000 (two claims at $1,000 each).


    The law of large numbers states that as the number of policyholders
    increases, the more confident the insurance company is its prediction will
    prove true. Therefore, they attempt to acquire a large number of similar
    policyholders who all contribute to a fund which will pay the losses.


    ## How premiums are calculated

    Insurers use risk data to calculate the likelihood of the event you are
    insuring against happening. This information is used to work out the cost of
    your premium. The more likely the event you are insuring against is to
    occur, the higher the risk to the insurer and, as a result, the higher the
    cost of your premium.


    An insurer will take two important factors into account when working out the
    premium they will charge.


    How likely is it in general terms that someone will need to make a claim?

    Is the person who wants to take out a policy a bigger or smaller risk than
    the ‘average’ policyholder (for example, a young person with a high-powered
    car may be charged a higher premium as they are statistically more likely to
    be involved in an accident than a mature, experienced driver)?

    Only a proportion of policyholders will make a claim in any one year.

    ## Cover Providers

    Instead of purchasing coverage from a centralized entity, DeFi insurance
    protocols allow users and companies to 

    purchase coverage from a decentralized pool of coverage providers. Anyone
    can be a coverage provider by locking 

    capital in a capital pool and exposing themselves to risk, just as liquidity
    providers do in lending protocols. 

    Cover providers invest their funds in pools with higher returns relative to
    the protocol's risk, which means that 

    individuals trade the outcomes of events based on their estimations of the
    probability of the underlying risk event. 

    If a protocol covered by the insurer suffers an adverse event such as a
    hack, the funds in the capital pool that covers 

    that protocol will be used to compensate users who purchased coverage
    against that specific event on that protocol. 

    Coverage providers are incentivized to provide liquidity and are rewarded
    for assuming risk by earning a return on 

    their capital. The yield is a percentage of premiums paid, presenting a
    correlation between the premium paid and 

    the risk for the protocol under consideration. However, DeFi insurers often
    include their own liquidity mining 

    incentives in their yield calculation, which are used to bootstrap liquidity
    for the pools.

    ## Insurance Policy Components

    When choosing a policy, it is important to understand how insurance works.


    A firm understanding of these concepts goes a long way in helping you choose
    the policy that best suits your needs. For instance, whole life insurance
    may or may not be the right type of life insurance for you. Three components
    of any type of insurance are crucial: premium, policy limit, and deductible.


    ### Premium

    A policy’s premium is its price, typically expressed as a monthly cost. The
    premium is determined by the insurer based on your or your business’s risk
    profile, which may include creditworthiness.


    For example, if you own several expensive automobiles and have a history of
    reckless driving, you will likely pay more for an auto policy than someone
    with a single midrange sedan and a perfect driving record. However,
    different insurers may charge different premiums for similar policies. So
    finding the price that is right for you requires some legwork.



    ### Policy Limit

    The policy limit is the maximum amount that an insurer will pay under a
    policy for a covered loss. Maximums may be set per period (e.g., annual or
    policy term), per loss or injury, or over the life of the policy, also known
    as the lifetime maximum.


    Typically, higher limits carry higher premiums. For a general life insurance
    policy, the maximum amount that the insurer will pay is referred to as the
    face value, which is the amount paid to a beneficiary upon the death of the
    insured.


    ### Deductible

    The deductible is a specific amount that the policyholder must pay out of
    pocket before the insurer pays a claim. Deductibles serve as deterrents to
    large volumes of small and insignificant claims.


    Deductibles can apply per policy or per claim, depending on the insurer and
    the type of policy. Policies with very high deductibles are typically less
    expensive because the high out-of-pocket expense generally results in fewer
    small claims.
