    How Insurance Works


    How Insurance Works



    ## Law of Large Numbers

    Insurance companies use the law of large numbers to estimate the losses a
    certain group of insureds may have in the future. For example, using
    statistics, an Actuary looks at losses that have occurred in the past and
    predicts that in the future approximately two out of 100 policyholders will
    have a claim. Thus, if the company writes 100 automobile policies, it may
    expect to pay two claims. This is referred to as loss frequency.


    Insurers must also determine the average cost of claims over time, or loss
    severity. If the average claim resulted in the company paying $1,000, then
    the Actuary will predict that total losses for the upcoming year will be
    $2,000 (two claims at $1,000 each).


    The law of large numbers states that as the number of policyholders
    increases, the more confident the insurance company is its prediction will
    prove true. Therefore, they attempt to acquire a large number of similar
    policyholders who all contribute to a fund which will pay the losses.

    ## Cover Providers

    Instead of purchasing coverage from a centralized entity, DeFi insurance
    protocols allow users and companies to 

    purchase coverage from a decentralized pool of coverage providers. Anyone
    can be a coverage provider by locking 

    capital in a capital pool and exposing themselves to risk, just as liquidity
    providers do in lending protocols. 

    Cover providers invest their funds in pools with higher returns relative to
    the protocol's risk, which means that 

    individuals trade the outcomes of events based on their estimations of the
    probability of the underlying risk event. 

    If a protocol covered by the insurer suffers an adverse event such as a
    hack, the funds in the capital pool that covers 

    that protocol will be used to compensate users who purchased coverage
    against that specific event on that protocol. 

    Coverage providers are incentivized to provide liquidity and are rewarded
    for assuming risk by earning a return on 

    their capital. The yield is a percentage of premiums paid, presenting a
    correlation between the premium paid and 

    the risk for the protocol under consideration. However, DeFi insurers often
    include their own liquidity mining 

    incentives in their yield calculation, which are used to bootstrap liquidity
    for the pools.
