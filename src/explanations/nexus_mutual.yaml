    Nexus Mutual is a discretionary mutual that allows members to buy cover
    products to protect against material losses when transferring funds into a
    protocol’s smart contracts or keeping funds with a custodian. Members can
    hold NXM tokens, which represent proportional ownership of the mutual, buy
    cover products, contribute to the funds, assess risks or claims, and
    participate in governance by creating new proposals or voting on them. Nexus
    Mutual is the most significant DeFi insurance protocol in the cryptocurrency
    market. 


    Nexus Mutual is a decentralized protocol that enables organizations and
    people to buy insurance policies that guard against the particular risks
    associated with platforms that are decentralized (DeFi) or centralized
    (CeFi). Without the need for a centralized insurance provider, Nexus Mutual
    is an Ethereum-based platform that enables users from all over the world to
    share insurance risks. The members of the Nexus Mutual platform decide
    whether claims are legitimate, and smart contracts record and enforce their
    choices. This eliminates the need to have faith in an insurance company
    because claim payments are enforced by token-driven economic incentives. All
    mutual members have legal agreements supporting their membership rights,
    represented by cryptocurrency tokens used throughout the insurance platform.

- title: Types of Covers
  shortTitle: Covers
  key: covers
  details: >
    Nexus Mutual consists of three types of covers-


    1. Protocol Covers 

    2. Custody Cover 

    3. Yield Token Cover


    Cover is only ever applicable to specific types of events and is always
    protocol- or token-specific. A protocol cover policy, for instance, won't
    safeguard money held on a custodial platform. Cover is used as an
    alternative to “insurance” in traditional finance.


    ### Protocol Covers

    Protocol covers are generally to protect and safeguards assets in the event
    of a protocol, smart contract failure, or oracle misuse. They are necessary
    because smart contacts can be hacked due to flaws in them. Primarily it
    includes-


    1. Economic design failure 

    2. Governance attacks

    3. Severe oracle failure 

    4. Protection for Non-Ethereum smart contracts

    5. Protection for assets on Layer-2


    ### Custody Covers

    In the case of an attack on a custodial platform—one that seizes custody of
    user cash when they engage with it—this kind of insurance protects that
    money. Cover the dangers of money being stolen or the withdrawal being
    stopped. Popular custodial platforms include Coinbase and BlockFi. 


    ### Yield Token Cover

    Funds are protected by yield token cover in the event that a yield token—a
    token included in a yield-generating protocol, like yDAI—loses its peg to
    its underlying asset and therefore loses some of its value. There is
    protection against yield token protocol failure or peg loss for Yearn,
    Convex, Idle USDT, and other cryptocurrencies.
- title: NXM Token
  shortTitle: nxm token
  key: nxm-token

    The governance token of the mutual, NXM, is used to connect the internal
    economics of the mutual so that the platform may respond dynamically to
    market conditions and capitalization levels and reward active members for
    participating in the mutual's daily operations. To hold NXM, one must be a
    member of the mutual. 



    Members can take part in risk and claim assessments using NXM. The cost of
    cover, which may also be purchased with ETH and DAI, can also be paid with
    NXM. Members can also take part in governance by casting NXM votes on ideas.
    Members decide the protocol's destiny through these votes.
- title: Claim Assesment
  shortTitle: claims
  key: claims
  details: >
    Members who stake NXM act as claim assessors and decide whether to approve a
    claim. The claims are processed within 72 hours. For a claim that needs
    approval, the loss of funds must-


    1. Fall into various categories which are mentioned in the cover policy
    contract

    2. Occur within the defined time period

    3. Be significant enough to account for as a claim


    The claimant must additionally provide evidence of their loss or that they
    were unable to withdraw money. This might be a 0-value transaction or a
    signature. An account statement, a notification from the protocol describing
    a hack, or another sort of warning could serve as additional proof.
