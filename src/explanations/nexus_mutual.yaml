    ## Intro to Nexus Mutual

    Nexus Mutual is a decentralized insurance platform that uses blockchain
    technology to create a risk-sharing pool in the form of a mutual. The
    platform is built on the Ethereum public chain and allows anyone to become a
    member and purchase cover. It replaces the idea of a traditional insurance
    company because it is wholly owned by the members. The model encourages
    engagement as members will get economic incentives for participating in risk
    assessment, claims assessment, and governance.


    ## Membership Requirements

    Becoming a member of the NXM mutual gives you ownership rights to the assets
    of the company, and a one-time membership fee of 0.0020 ETH. In order to
    become a member, you will need to verify your identity using our
    Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process. The NXM token represents membership rights
    in the mutual, with all members owning the company together in proportion to
    their individual NXM holdings.


    ## Risk Assessment and Staking

    Members in Nexus Mutual can earn rewards for staking against the security of
    a protocol or custodian. This means that Nexus Mutual stakers may lose their
    stake if a successful claim is made against the security of a protocol or
    custodian. Therefore, staking with Nexus Mutual should be considered as
    active rather than passive staking.


    ## Claim Assessment

    Members who stake NXM act as claim assessors and decide whether to approve a
    claim. The claims are processed within 72 hours. For a claim that needs
    approval, the loss of funds must-


    1. Fall into various categories which are mentioned in the cover policy
    contract

    2. Occur within the defined time period

    3. Be significant enough to account for as a claim


    The claimant must additionally provide evidence of their loss or that they
    were unable to withdraw money. This might be a 0-value transaction or a
    signature. An account statement, a notification from the protocol describing
    a hack, or another sort of warning could serve as additional proof.

  key: covers

    Nexus Mutual consists of three types of covers-


    1. Protocol Covers 

    2. Custody Cover 

    3. Yield Token Cover


    Cover is only ever applicable to specific types of events and is always
    protocol- or token-specific. A protocol cover policy, for instance, won't
    safeguard money held on a custodial platform. Cover is used as an
    alternative to “insurance” in traditional finance.


    ### Protocol Covers

    Protocol covers are generally to protect and safeguards assets in the event
    of a protocol, smart contract failure, or oracle misuse. They are necessary
    because smart contacts can be hacked due to flaws in them. Primarily it
    includes-


    1. Economic design failure 

    2. Governance attacks

    3. Severe oracle failure 

    4. Protection for Non-Ethereum smart contracts

    5. Protection for assets on Layer-2


    ### Custody Covers

    In the case of an attack on a custodial platform—one that seizes custody of
    user cash when they engage with it—this kind of insurance protects that
    money. Cover the dangers of money being stolen or the withdrawal being
    stopped. Popular custodial platforms include Coinbase and BlockFi. 


    ### Yield Token Cover

    Funds are protected by yield token cover in the event that a yield token—a
    token included in a yield-generating protocol, like yDAI—loses its peg to
    its underlying asset and therefore loses some of its value. There is
    protection against yield token protocol failure or peg loss for Yearn,
    Convex, Idle USDT, and other cryptocurrencies.

    The governance token of the mutual, NXM, is used to connect the internal
    economics of the mutual so that the platform may respond dynamically to
    market conditions and capitalization levels and reward active members for
    participating in the mutual's daily operations. To hold NXM, one must be a
    member of the mutual. 



    Members can take part in risk and claim assessments using NXM. The cost of
    cover, which may also be purchased with ETH and DAI, can also be paid with
    NXM. Members can also take part in governance by casting NXM votes on ideas.
    Members decide the protocol's destiny through these votes.
